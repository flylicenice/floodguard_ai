# 🌊 FloodGuard AI

AI-Powered Hyperlocal Flood Risk & Response Platform

## 📌 Project Description

FloodGuard AI is a smart flood risk prediction and emergency response mobile application built using Flutter and Google technologies.

Flooding is one of the most frequent and destructive natural disasters, especially in vulnerable communities with limited early warning systems. Many existing systems provide general alerts but lack **hyperlocal, real-time, AI-driven insights** that help individuals take immediate action.

FloodGuard AI solves this problem by:

- Providing AI-based flood risk predictions
- Visualizing risk levels on an interactive map
- Offering actionable safety recommendations

---

## 🎯 Alignment with AI & Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence

FloodGuard AI uses machine learning models to:

- Analyze rainfall data
- Evaluate historical flood patterns
- Classify flood risk levels (Low, Medium, High)
- Generate intelligent safety recommendations

AI enables predictive analysis instead of reactive response.

### 🌍 Sustainable Development Goals

FloodGuard AI directly supports:

**SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation**  
→ Promotes water safety and reduces contamination risks during floods.

**SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities**  
→ Enhances disaster resilience through early warning systems.

**SDG 13 – Climate Action**  
→ Uses data-driven insights to mitigate climate-related risks.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### 💻 Frontend

- Flutter (Cross-platform mobile development)
- Google Maps API (Location & visualization)
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (Push notifications)

### ☁️ Backend

- Firebase Firestore (Real-time database)
- Firebase Authentication (Secure login system)
- AI Prediction Model (Risk classification algorithm)

## 🔎 Google Technology Utilization (Cause & Effect)

We used **Google Maps Platform** to visualize real-time flood risk geographically.  
→ This allows users to clearly see affected zones and plan safer routes.

We used **Firebase Firestore** for real-time cloud data storage.  
→ This ensures instant synchronization of flood alerts across all users.

We used **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for push notifications.  
→ This enables immediate flood warnings, improving emergency response time.

We used **OpenWeather** to get real time weather forecasts.  
→ This allows users to view weather forecasts of most locations in Malaysia.

We used **Flutter** as the development framework.  
→ This ensures cross-platform accessibility (Android & iOS) with high performance.
